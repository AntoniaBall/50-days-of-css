### 50 days of CSS
This personnal project is based on the CSS udemy course of Brad Traversly '50 projects in 50 days'.
I followed this course because i wanted a daily challenge in CSS, a short project to do every day to mastering the sheet language.

Each day has a folder and a litlle video of the result of the exercice.
Those exercices were made with only HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. The goal here was to master only CSS without frameworks.

### Method of realisation
I only visualised the project intro course of the day, but I writted the code myself, so it may differ from Brad's one.
